This project centers on the development of an interactive dashboard to tell a data-driven climate story, focusing on CO2 emissions. The dashboard is built using Dash, a Python framework, and displays CO2 measurements from NOAA's airborne observational data. Users can explore CO2 levels collected by specific air sample containers over time and at various geographic locations.

The app addresses the challenge of "Tell us a climate story" by enabling users to visualize the temporal and spatial variations in CO2 concentrations. It presents real-world data, allowing users to engage with the science of climate change more directly and tangibly, emphasizing how CO2 levels fluctuate and accumulate in different regions of the atmosphere.

This is important because CO2 is a major driver of climate change, and understanding its distribution is key to addressing global warming. By making the data accessible and visual, the project helps raise awareness about the impact of human activities on atmospheric CO2 levels, contributing to a more informed dialogue on climate action.
